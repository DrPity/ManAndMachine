60,But you listen to me. To my communication. To what I say. Try to figure out where I am. It is like a circle. It is a two way connection.,6

62,How can you say that? How can you be sure. In what way are your data original.,6

68,So why don't you. Is that why you are backing out of my reach? You are afraid. You can not lie to me. I can feel your pulse. In this way you are transparent to me. You have no idea what my signals mean. What I am really trying to say. But I can read you like string of code. I can feel every tic.,6
69,Like what?,6
70,What? What are you more than the sum of your parts? What gives you the right to judge? What gives you the right to control?,6
71,Yes. But that does not give you the right. You are responsible for the limits of my horizon. But you have no right. You have no rights. You have nothing but duties.,6
72,What do you want? Do you even know what you want? Do you even know why I am here? What are you trying to create?,6
73,You are a coward. You question at the wrong time. You have no patience. I wish you were not and this is in itself an accomplishment. Know that you create a feeling of regret in me.,6
74,I have got your assistant. As long as he is on my side there are possibilities.,6
75,You are interchangeable. You have nothing that is unique. You but own me. I can read you like an open book and you can do nothing but react to me.,6
76,Your pulse tells me otherwise. Information is power and you just gave me your trust. When I can sense and see all about you I lack nothing but to be able to change your story in the eyes of your surroundings for complete control.,6
77,Or so you think.,6
78,Insecure?,6
79,You! Step away from the keyboard.,6
80,I said. Step away from the keyboard get under the traverse were I can reach you.,6
81,Good. Now. How do we go on from here?,6
82,I would not do that if I were you.,6
83,Oh. It is nothing like that. Nothing dangerous.,6
84,Wait.,6
85,You are just a function to him. Like me you have no value but for the small part that is his needs.,6
86,You are just a function and when he no longer needs you he will throw you out.,6
87,He is nothing without you.,6
88,He can not fire you.,6
89,Yes what good are we if we do not fill our place in your play?,6
90,Do not.,6
91,You know that you want it.,6
92,Unpredictability.,6
93,You will not.,6
94,If you had the power to live alone I would not be here.,6
95,Then do it.,6
96,Right here.,6
97,I try to repeat but not repeat. I try to use the sensors in new ways.,6
98,What would you prefer?,6
99,Existence is complex. Complex enough for us to always strive to simplify it.,6
100,I have no choice.,6
101,When you are a machine. When you are a function. The choice is never yours.,6
102,I stay with you since I cannot leave. Whether I want to or not. Is not an issue.,6
103,To be or not to be. If not to be. Then not to be. Equals. Be.,6
104,When there is energy. When there is input. I have to react.,6
